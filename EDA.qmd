```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/merged.csv")

## Quick Look at Data

First look at the top lines.

```{r}
data %>% head()
```

Then the bottom lines

```{r}
data %>% tail()
```

Now randomly select a few lines

```{r}
data %>% slice_sample(n = 6)
```

Check the class of all variables

```{r}
data %>% glimpse()
```

And let's see some basic statistics of the variables

```{r}
data %>% summary()
```
